Artifact: surprise

***Description***
In my programming language class in fall 2023, my professor developed his own programming language. The assignment worth 
48% of our grade is called a compiler, which is a program within a computer that translates the source code of a 
programming language into some other type of code (machine code, bytecode, etc.) to allow for the computer to understand 
what the code means and how it works. 



***Reflection and self-development***
This project came as a surprise to me to implement as an artifact because of its difficulty. Part of it is becasue I have
no specific interest in this area of programming langauge, as I would rather develop a mobile app. In this case, this
project definitely confirmed that I would prefer to not just focus on computer science, but prefer to integrate my passion
and knowledge of health/medicine. Sometimes it is the hard times that allow for you to grow. Not only has this confirmed
my future aspiration and area in my field, but also showed me much teamwork and collaboration. Many of the people in my class 
I did not know well or had only recgonized their faces. Within three months, I am now able to work with many of the peers in
my class. Though I am disappointed that it has taken almost three years to get to this point, I am glad that we are all now
better friends and closer than before all because of this project.
